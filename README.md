# ABOUT.

Program introduction
The Hyper-x app is being developed by the Hacktor team. Programming has begun in Agu 2018 and is currently preparing and developing for the big deal.
The program aims to monitor all systems, network devices, devices that access the Internet and even test their intrusion. It also manages and monitors all web services, such as the docker, which you can monitor and control to suit your needs.
By installing the Hyper-x engine you can access the web application as well as its mobile applications for free and easily control your computer systems and services around the world.
Even network engineers and network security engineers can test the security of their systems with a few clicks to install security AddOn.

The system architecture is designed so that you can write Python for your desktop and sell it for free or in the Hypermarket. All the technology used in the system is told on hacktor.co's website what language you can write for each platform.
The code and program architecture are described separately in a separate document. You can find this address
